This covers the installation of the Finger Lakes Instrumentation SDK
wrappers on Linux. Anyone who is able to modify things to work on Darwin or
Windows is welcome to make a contribution.

Linux Installation
==================

As currently configured a number of steps must be taken in order for pyfli
to be installed and work properly.

dependencies
------------

gcc compiler
kernel headers -- for compiling the FLI usb driver
python headers -- for compiling the python extension
numpy -- numpy package

The details of how to install the dependencies will vary from distro to
distro, but they should all be available through the package manager.

fliusb driver installation
--------------------------

Note that this needs to be done each time a new kernel is installed, which
may be often in a distribution like Fedora. From inside the pyfli git
repository the steps are

cd fliusb-1.3
make clean
make
sudo cp fliusb.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra
sudo depmod

Once this is done the driver will be automatically loaded when a FLI usb
device is plugged in. The module directory location used above works for my
distribution, Fedora 17, it may need to be modified for other
distributions. Note, Ubuntu uses 'misc' instead of 'extra'.

udev configuration
------------------

The default permissions of the /dev/fliusb[0-9]* device node created when a
FLI device is plugged in only allow root access. This may be changed and
the device name customized by adding a rules script to /etc/udev/rules.d.
An example script 10-local.rules.example can serve as a template for this,
strip the '.example' extension, modify as needed, and do the copy. The
results can be checked by plugging in a FLI device and looking at the
permissions of the created /dev node. After installing the file it may be
necessary to reload the rules.

sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

pyfli module installation
-------------------------

Do

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

or as I prefer

python setup.py install --user


Windows Installation
====================

dependencies
------------

The exact dependencies will vary a lot depending on the windows setup. It
is probably easiest to use some standard package such as python(x,y) or the
enthought distribution. I tested installation on Windows 7 using
python(x,y). Python(x,y) comes with the mingw32 compiler along with numpy
and a lot of other useful python packages. In any case, you will need all
of the following in addition to the FLI usb drivers:

compiler
python
numpy

fliusb driver installation
--------------------------

The FLI drivers can be obtained by installing the FLI Software Installation
Kit from  http://www.fli-cam.com/software/index.html. If you have a 64 bit
OS, get the 64 bit version, and for a 32 bit OS the 32 bit version. That is
independent of whether the installed python is 64 or 32 bit.

pyfli module installation
-------------------------

Same as for Linux, from a console do

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

or as I prefer

python setup.py install --user


Macintosh installation
======================

The module compiles on Macintosh. You will need the xcode compilers, numpy,
and python. The details will depend on the version of OSX, some of which
are more troublesome than others. That is all moot, however, as no drivers
are freely available. TheSkyX plugin from FLI probably has them, but it won't
install anything without TheSkyX present. There is also some indication
that libfli-1.104 is not up to date with regards to Darwin.
