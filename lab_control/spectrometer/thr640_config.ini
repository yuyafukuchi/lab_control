# Coefficients for convert wavelength to count
# This relations should be approximated by a polynomial. 
# poly_order determines how many coefficients to be used.
poly_order = 3
# If poly_order = 3, wavelength = coefficient0 + coefficient1 * x + coefficient2 * x**2
coefficient0 = 0
coefficient1 = 0
coefficient2 = 0
